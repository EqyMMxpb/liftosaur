      information.
    </h4>

    <p>
      We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information.
      Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our
      Cookie Policy.

    <h2>
      <a id="inforetain">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</a>
    </h2>
    <h4>
      <strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in
      this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
    </h4>
    <p>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
      privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other

      the period of time in which users have an account with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
      anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
      backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing
      until deletion is possible.

    <h2>
      <a id="infosafe">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</a>
    </h2>
    <h4>
      <strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and
      technical security measures.
    </h4>
    <p>
      We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of
      any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet
      itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
      information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure
      environment.

    <p>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature
      or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
      activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
      has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
      automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
      we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
