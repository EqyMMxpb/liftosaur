Super short and simple starting guide for the folks who want to start weightlifting.

To get stronger and look better, you essentially need 3 things:

- Lift heavy weights
- Eat well
- Sleep enough

To get started:

1. Go to [thefitness.wiki](https://www.thefitness.wiki), read articles about [muscle gain](https://thefitness.wiki/muscle-building-101/) in general and about [diet](https://thefitness.wiki/improving-your-diet/).

Then, if you have access to gym with **a barbell and a power rack** (recommended!)

2. Read about [Fitness Basic Beginner Routine](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/).
3. Google for videos how to make the exercises from there with a proper form. Like ["How to bench press with proper form"](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+bench+press+proper+form).
4. Go to [Liftosaur](https://www.liftosaur.com), select "Basic Beginner Routine" program, and start training.

If you don't have access to gym with barbell, but at least have **dumbbells of various weight and some sort of bench**:

2. Read about [Dumbbell PPL](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2e79y4/dumbbell_ppl_proposed_alternative_to_dumbbell/) program.
3. Google for videos how to make the exercises from there with a proper form. Like ["How to dumbbell chest press proper form"](https://www.google.com/search?q=How+to+dumbbell+chest+press+proper+form).
4. Go to [Liftosaur](https://www.liftosaur.com), select "Dumbbell PPL" program, and start training.

That's it. It's that simple. Whole initial reading and videos watching would probably take like 1 hour.
And then you'll spend around 40-60 minutes in gym about 3 times a week.
